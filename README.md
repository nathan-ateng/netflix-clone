API Integration

The NextFlix Clone uses an external API to fetch data about movies and TV shows. You will need to obtain an API key to access this data. Follow these steps to integrate the API:

    Obtain an API Key:
        Go to the API provider's website (e.g., TheMovieDB, OMDB, etc.) and sign up for an API key.

    Configure API Key:
        In the project directory, create a config.js file.

    javascript

// config.js

const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';

export default API_KEY;

Replace 'your-api-key-here' with your actual API key.

Use the API:

    In your JavaScript code (e.g., app.js), import the API key and use it to make requests to the API.

javascript

    // app.js

    import API_KEY from './config';

    // Use API_KEY in your API requests
